Women hating politics is just ineffective. Yes, a lot of women are annoying. Yes, feminism is problematic (although I jokingly larp as one). But the way how some “redpill” communities provides solutions to the gender conflict seems very reminiscent of communism. 

What I mean by communism is because of the fact that communism consistently advocates for an unnecessary division between the rich and the poor. That’s why communists advocate for a total destruction or even death of the bourgeoisie class to the extreme. They don’t promote unity or collaboration. Same with the gender conflict, redpill “anti-feminist” communities seem to treat women like garbage. Men and Women are both needed to sustain a healthy society. The bourgeoisie and the proletariat are both needed to sustain a healthy society. The best remedy to this conflict is to make both sides realize that both share a common legacy and ultimately the same fate as a one united nation of people. The best way to foster this is to have a benevolent monarch who is loved by most people or have a racially homogeneous unified state. 

A rebuttal question that I would most expect is “then why don’t you promote a collaboration between races not just genders and classes?” The simple answer is that weak tribes perish, while strong tribes flourish. Racial conflict is necessary for survival since the stronger tribe will always seek to expand. This doesn’t lead to extinction. In fact, you need this tension to ensure survival. When men and women start hating one another and fail to reproduce, the extinction of the tribe becomes imminent. With class, it is impossible to eradicate class. Empirical evidence suggest that this claim to be the truth.
