    your post came out on top.  Once we were trying to watch something with a bluetooth
    speaker and my daughter said, &quot;It seems like your notebook is trusty.&quot;  Well-said!  You
    helped pin down some of the reasons for this.  I think a big part of it is the

    further. I read many source online at prime, thinkpad X220 could work for 8 hours
    minimum with 44wh battery, and I hope it comes true, because I want to buy a new
    battery for it. Now I&#39;ve 9 cell battery, but it seems it&#39;s not original

    light browsing with FF on windows 10 20h2, writing word, etc. I dream this laptop
    for long time until I could get it.. In my country I need to pay installment (yeah,
    my monthly payment as uni lecturer is very low indeed), it cost me 252 USD and
    each month for 21 USD (it&#39;s a lot here, you could buy one month meal with
    that, with 1 full meal a day). \r\n\r\nI hope this machine could hold 10 years
    a head, as I still have lenovo netbook S10 on my uni lab, it still work good,
    just not for web browsing, but remote, code, run simple code, compile, hear music,
    it still work for 7 hours straight. I really amazed with well cared old laptop,

  body: "Your digital garden is very nice, came here from Simply Jekyll. It&#39;s
    aesthetically very appealing and has also a more modern look-n-feel compared to
    Simply Jekyll. Can you also add a way to search within the posts as Simply Jekyll
    does? That would make it like completely perfect for me. \r\n\r\nReally love the
    theme, thank you for creating it."

  body: I love my Thinkpad x220 too. Especially the keyboard. Why don&#39;t they make
    laptops with real keyboards nowadays? I code for a living, and I can&#39;t stand
    those Apple-inspired flat plastic keys with no travel that all laptops have. I
    can&#39;t be the only one.

  body: Found your X220 article, and completely agree. I too have a Retina MBP which
    I use for photography, but when it comes to my day job, which is programing, I
    think you&#39;re hard pressed to beat the X220. It&#39;s my daily driver for work,
    and the slower CPU actually helps me spot performance issues in my code earlier.
    I think that&#39;s part of the issue in the development community, we tend to
    have the top-of-the-line systems, which are amazing, but it doesn&#39;t help you
    optimize for performance. Throw OpenBSD on there, and enjoy coding nirvana.

  body: "I do a lot of writing and when I have a longer paper to write I hang out
    on the couch with my x220. I like the old fashioned keyboard over the new styled
    ones, although one big drawback is the lack of backlit keyboards which was the
    #1 reason for me buying a x230 when it came out. The thinklight simply isn&#39;t
    as good of a solution over backlit keys.\r\n\r\nAlthough I&#39;ve been using this
    machine for a decade, it still looks almost new. Because of its modular design,
    I have the freedom to replace parts as the wear. I&#39;ve replace the palm rest
    twist, costing around $10 each time. And I replaced the display for around $60
    when some pixels died on the original and the front cover for about $15.\r\n\r\nMy
    current primary machine is a Thinkpad T25, which I really like. All three surfaces
    are covered in soft touch rubber. But the compact size of the x220 just suits
    me better for use on my lap.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t remember replacing the keyboard,
    but it looks so new that I must have at one point. These older thinkpad are built
    to be fixed and maintained for little money. "

    digital garden theme. I never finished that project but I picked it up again recently.
    At some point I&#39;ll have to figure out how to add a blog and some other fun
    features (maybe a dark/light mode toggle?).
